# hello-world

Hey all,

My name is Sam. I'm a Freshman at Miami University. I've been doing Computer Science for almost two years now, and I really enjoy it.
I'm finally teaching myself how to use Github, so that I can start teaching myself how to write emulators. I'm hoping I'll find other
projects worth investing my time into as well.
